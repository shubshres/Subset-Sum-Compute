# Subset-Sum-Compute
 C program that computes subset sums for all possible cardinalities.

Asside:
- Input is read from a standard input (which can be either: a. keybaord typing, b. a shell redirect (<) from a file, or c. cut-and-paste. 
- The first input line will have n, the number of positive integer values appearing on the subsequent lines, and m, the target value. 
- Each of the reamining input lines will include one of the m sequence values (unordered). 
- The ouput includes: a. the input, appropriately labeled, b. the dynamic programming table, and c. backtrace for a computed solution for every subset cardinality has a solution. 
- This program uses dynamic programming and utilizes dynamically allocated arrays.
